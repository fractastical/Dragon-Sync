Dragon Breath

Dragon Breath is a command line tool to import class libraries stored in git repositories and use them for multiple (Force.com) projects.

Basic functionality is as follows:

bash add.sh project_repo_address project_folder

This adds a project to your app as a git submodule.  For example, you might do:

bash add.sh git@github.com:apex-commons/StringUtils.git ApexCommonsStringUtils

This adds the submodule to your git repository in the folder submodules/ApexCommonsStringUtils. It also adds an entry to the SUBMODPATHS file. If you don’t want to use all of files in the repository you can change the path in this file.

The next step is to update:

bash update.sh

This updates each submodule to the master, copies the files so they are ready for deployment, and (via a ruby script) generates any missing meta xml files. This allows you to keep chunky xml files outside of your repositories if you want.

To export you must update entries in the PROJECTPATHS file. For the moment, all you need to do is:

Now you are ready to export:

    bash export.sh

That’s all. All of the files will now be in your project path and ready for deployment.

Note: at some point in the near future I also plan to support non-class files (e.g. Static Resources, Visualforce components, etc.) and eventually packaging, namespacing, running tests, and deployment. I have a Ruby library already supports many of these things but it is not as robust as I need to use for everyday deployment.
